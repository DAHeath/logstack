\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
  \input{fig/nested}
  \caption{%
    The na\"ive stacking of four circuits.
    Conditionals are nested two levels deep; per the \stack algorithm,
    this forces the players to recursively emulate themselves which
    leads to quadratic cost in the number of branches for both players.
  }\label{fig:nested}

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
  \input{fig/vector}
  \caption{%
    The vectorized stacking of four circuits.
    The evaluator pays only linear cost to evaluate all four branches,
    but the generator pays quadratic cost in the number of branches.
  }\label{fig:vector}
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
  \input{fig/optimized}
  \caption{%
    Our stacking optimization.
    The four conditional branches are stacked by nesting, but the
    multiplexer is not stacked.
    By leaving the multiplexer unstacked, we prevent the players from
    recursively emulating themselves at quadratic cost.

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \centering
  \input{fig/seed-tree}
  \caption{%
    Suppose there are $8$ branches $\cir_0$ through $\cir_7$, and
    suppose \E guesses that $\cir_0$ is the taken branch.
    If the taken branch is in the subtree $\cir_4$ through $\cir_7$,
    \E will generate the same garbage material for the entire subtree,
    regardless of which branch is actually taken.
    By extension, $\cir_0$ can only be evaluated against $\log 8 = 3$ garbage
    material strings: one for each sibling subtree (sibling subtrees
    are bracketed).
