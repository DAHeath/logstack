explicitly say XOR
explicitly say XOR of b material strings

a large class of natural constructions have natural limitations

branch garbled circuit

\hat{\cal{C}} garbling you don't know


For security, Eval garbles each branch at least once.


material is either useful or not useful (useless?)


black box access to everything from underlying scheme
introduce pools earlier (in first paragraph)
  pool has 1 correct
  pool has 0 or more incorrect



cast the material as C_j for evaluation


unstacked
count unstackings rather than usages


However, we will show there are restrictions that arise from security

Another word for unuseful materials (incorrect)




How to prove Standard assumptions:
  The underlying scheme must generate an output labeling indist from
  randomness
