\section{Instantiation}\label{sec:instantiation}

We implemented  \ourscheme in $\sim1500$ lines of C++ and used it to instantiate a semihonest 2PC protocol.
We instantiated \underscheme\ using the half-gates~\cite{EC:ZahRosEva15}, allowing high
concrete performance.
Our implementation thus relies on non-standard assumptions.
%
We use computational security parameter $\kappa=127$; the $128$th bit is reserved for point and permute.
%
Our implementation spawns additional threads to make use of inherent
parallelism available in $\gbcond$ and $\evcond$.

In the following section, we discuss an experimental evaluation of our
implementation.
All experiments were performed on a MacBook Pro laptop with an Intel
Dual-Core i5 3.1 GHz processor and 8GB of RAM.
%
% Our chosen benchmark involves the two players securely computing a
% conditional composition of many copies of the SHA-256 circuit.
